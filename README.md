# Origin Story:

The year is 2020, and a deadly virus rages beyond the safety of our apartment. Morale is low - even Bill, my roommate's cat, is anxious and restless. 

Having lost access to my studio and shared making facilities, I begin to lean on more compact materials to work with within the constraints of my bedroom and our living room. I teach myself rug making. Cross stitch for hours on end. Bake cheesecakes like my life depends on it. 

And, I learn to code.
